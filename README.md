# Algorithm
<p>Algorithm for calculating grades of the circle, for comparing who are the random selected items.</p>

<p>The formula at the end was simple</p>

**360/total items in the circle**

<p>After each item has an initial degree and ending degree.
For example in 16 items, the intervals are of 22,5 degrees.</p>
